# ForC_education

**ForC_Cirriculum** contains detailed lesson plans for high school to graduate level. It includes instructions on how to access ForC, ask original questions, and focuses primarily on carbonn cycling. It is essentially the length of a standard high school unit plan that is about half a college semester, but since it also prompts students to ask unique questions and provides access to ForC it can be used for new research. 

**ForC_Short_Lesson** is a 90 minute self-contained lesson plan aimed at early to mid high school students. It provides detailed steps on using github and Microsoft Excel to create a simple linear regression from ForC data. 

**ForC_Data_Nugget** is a develping educational resource for http://datanuggets.org/ based on the in-press paper by Cook-Patton et al.
